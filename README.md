# new-relayer-standard
currently i am busy with promethon<br>
but i am gonna add better doc, nounce support, address mapping support and some other things to this later
 ## road map
 - [x] create the standard version 1 to 3
 - [x] create the standard version 4
 - [ ] write script that can automatically rewrite and compiles contract with this standard
 - [ ] write golang code for relayer
 - [ ] write js code for relayer
 - [ ] write react code for relayer client

## lets make a chalange!
let us all look for a solution that can fix the bug proposed in the contract relayer04 for double calling in the given scenario
